# Sudoku
Another CLI Sudoku game implemented in Java using Memento and Adapter Design Pattern, collaborated with [Kaxl](https://github.com/Kaxl).

## Run
To play Sudoku :
```
git clone https://github.com/rudy2707/Sudoku.git
cd Sudoku/src
make
make run
```

## SudoKiller
The algorithm of the Sudoku solver is from [here](http://www.kernel-panic.it/software/sudokiller/sudokiller.java.html). This code is integrated in my Sudoku game with Adapter Design Pattern.
